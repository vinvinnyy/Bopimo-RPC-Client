## How to Setup

>[!Note]
>You need to download Python 3.11.6 before going here
>https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3116/

1. Go to the Developer Portal (https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Make a new application name it whatever (whatever your application is named it will show when your not on Bopimo!)
3. Click on the application and go to OAuth2 and copy the client ID
4. Now go download the files for this repository and unzip the files
5. Open the .py file in your IDE (or text editor, anything works)
6. Now the copied client id you just copied now put the ID into the code that says

   ```
   client_id = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
   ```

7. Insert the client id where the X's are
8. Now run the bat file and it will download the modules

>[!Note]
>You need to download VSCode before going to step 9
>(Why you might ask, it because due to just opening it by python launcher itself will not recognizing module pypresence (thing to do the RPC)  i recommend running the batch file then opening the python file on vscode or any IDE that can run code in it ill be fixng that error later on)

9. Open the .py file once again and run it on a IDE or text editor that can run code
And your done!
